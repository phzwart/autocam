## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need Python 3.9+ and the following tools:

- [Conda] (for environment management)
- [Poetry] (for dependency management)
- [Nox] (for testing)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/phzwart/autocam.git
$ cd autocam
```

### Step 2: Create and activate the conda environment

```console
$ conda create -n autocam python=3.10 -y
$ conda activate autocam
```

### Step 3: Install Poetry and project dependencies

```console
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```

### Step 4: Install pre-commit hooks (recommended)

```console
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```

This will automatically run formatting and linting checks before each commit.

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

```console
$ poetry run python
$ poetry run autocam
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/

## How to test the project

Make sure you're in the `autocam` conda environment:

```console
$ conda activate autocam
```

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ poetry run nox
```

Or run with a specific Python version:

```console
$ poetry run nox --python=3.10
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ poetry run nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ poetry run nox --session=tests
```

Or run pre-commit checks:

```console
$ poetry run nox --session=pre-commit
```

Unit tests are located in the _tests_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

**Note**: The project uses pre-commit hooks that automatically format and lint your code before commits. If you haven't installed them, run:

```console
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 85%+ code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.
- All pre-commit hooks must pass (black, flake8, isort, etc.).

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ poetry run pre-commit install
```

**Pro tip**: The pre-commit hooks will automatically run when you commit, but you can also run them manually:

```console
$ poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.
