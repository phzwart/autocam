# Session and Working Group Schema Definition
# This file defines the structure for parallel sessions and working groups

# Working Group Schema
working_group:
  name: "string" # Name of the working group
  description: "string (optional)" # Description of the working group
  participants: ["string", "string", ...] # List of participant names in this group

# Parallel Session Schema
parallel_session:
  name: "string" # Name of the parallel session
  description: "string (optional)" # Description of the parallel session
  working_groups:
    # List of working group objects
    - name: "string" # Name of the working group
      description: "string (optional)" # Description of the working group
      participants: ["string", "string", ...] # List of participant names in this group

# Validation Rules
validation_rules:
  working_group:
    - "name cannot be empty"
    - "must have at least one participant"
    - "participant names must be unique within the group"
    - "all participant names must exist in the conference"

  parallel_session:
    - "name cannot be empty"
    - "must have at least one working group"
    - "each participant can only appear once per session"
    - "all participant names must exist in the conference"

        description: "A single working group"
        participants: ["model_1"]
